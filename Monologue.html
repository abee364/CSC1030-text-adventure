            <p>“Well as I was saying our systems are failing, including all vital systems and a gas leak has broken
                out in the control room which is also on fire.
                I suggest you hurry before the fire ignites the gas and explodes the ship.
                You also should know that you only have 5 minutes before the gas leaks into the filteration system.
                So get going!
                And good luck!” </p>
