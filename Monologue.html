        <p>“Well as I was saying our systems are failing, including all vital systems and a gas leak has broken out in
            the
            control room which is also. I suggest you hurry before the fire ignites the gas and explodes the ship. You
            also
            should know that you only have 5 minutes before the gas leaks into the filteration system. So get going! And
            good
            luck!” </p>
