                <p>Computer: Hello there ’insert name’ we have a problem, the ship seems to have malfunctioned and as
                    such our systems have begun rapidly failing and…”

                <!-- Room Becomes Mildly Darker But Not Pitch Black -->
                <p>“Well as I was saying our systems are failing, including all vital systems and a gas leak has broken
                    out in the control room which is also on fire.
                    I suggest you hurry before the fire ignites the gas and explodes the ship.
                    You also should know that you only have 5 minutes before the gas leaks into the filteration system.
                    So get going!
                    And good luck!” </p>
